	Need a struct representation of snowflake:
		Index Identifier?   (memory)
		3d array of coordinates, 
		localized origin(center)    (scene)
[array]	Mximum and minimum values of each x, y, and z
        
	void (*function) int??
[array]	a,b,c coefficients for the ellipse

	array of pointers to neighbors? or integers of indecies in the array

// What about a three-way collision?


For collisions it is okay to lose information because neighbors are stored

if we are updating ellipses we are doing something wrong
